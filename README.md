# DAW1-Markup-Language-Project
First-year markup language project for Web Development, we were tasked with creating the front-end of an online store.
Our teacher asked us to use the little knowledge we had of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the front-end of an online store. I decided to focus on gym accessories.
